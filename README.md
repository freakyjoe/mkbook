To contribute, send a pull request. This project uses 
[ZeroMQ RFC 42](http://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:42) as its contribution process.

These are the tools I use to build my books. They are not packaged or 
documented for public use. I'm not accepting pull requests or patches
at this stage.

* To install, you need all the tools in bin/, somewhere on your path. I
suggest copying them to /usr/local/bin.

* To use, take the directory example/, and copy to a new directory that
represents your book project.


Required Linux packages:

- rasterizer from libbatik-java (Ubuntu). You might also want to install libxmlgraphics-common-java (Ubuntu).
- pygmentize from python-pygments (Ubuntu)
- Perl Tree::Trie

## Workflow

- Edit each chapter as a file chnn.txt
- run ./build in produce
- this produces ODF, HTML, MD files
- for printable PDF, load ODF in LibreOffice and save as PDF/A-a1.

For an index, set the INDEX variable in the .book file to a file
(index.txt is an example) containing one keyword per line. To 
create categories, write "word | category".

E.g.

    belgium | country
    canada | country

The templating system works by inserting symbols from the .book file into
templates. There are a few symbols known to the mkodt script: FILENAME,
INDEX, BREAKS, INSIDE, OUTSIDE, HRIGHT. The others are only known to the
templates.

## Model Document

To check/modify the ODT templates, you have to know how to expand an ODT
file using unzip, then you can copy/paste code from the various ODT sub
files into the templates.

The model directory contains a model.odt that you can use for this purpose.

To format an XML file to be readable:

    xmllint --pretty 1 somefile.xml > x && mv x somefile.xml
